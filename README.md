# Electric-car-Usage

A project that tests the knowledge of pandas library in manipulation and data analysis
By Edwin Mutuma

## Description
This project used a dataset availed by Dalberg data and the task was to clean the data, manipulate the data and analyse the data as needed to come up with viable recommendations for understanding electric car usage over time. 
The dataset used in this project was provided and will be linked above. The process starts off by loading the datasets into a notebook of choice,(In this case it was the colab notebook by Google), and creating dataframes from the dtasets provided. From there, we cleaned the data which included dealing with null values, duplicated values and renaming the columns. 
 
## Steps in our description
1. Load datasets
2. Preview the datasets
3. Check for missing data
4. Check for duplicates in our data
5. Making our data uniform
 
## Technologies Used
Being a data science project, the project required data analysis and manipulation which was to be done by Python programming language using the Pandas Library. To track our tasks, we have used the Trello tool.

In case of any querries, corrections or additions, feel free to reach me and share. Corrections are most welcome since I have just begun the journey and being pointed in the right direction would actually go a long way in helping me grow and learn and become a better data scientist. The goal of data is insight and if you find insight, do let me know.
